/*
 * NOTE: this test's expectations encode *ReactOS's* AFD behaviour, not real
 * Windows's. Run against a real Windows AFD it fails 20 of its 107 tests.
 *
 * Provenance: measured on 2026-08-24 by running this very test binary on
 * Windows 11 Pro 22621, built for both i386 and x86_64. The 20 failures are
 * byte-for-byte identical on the two architectures - same line numbers, same
 * values, same order - so these are not structure-layout or pointer-width
 * problems; an x86_64 layout bug would fail on amd64 only. The sibling
 * afd apitest "send" passes 11 of 11 on both architectures, so socket
 * creation and connect are fine against real AFD; what diverges is specific
 * to AFD_INFO_RECEIVE_WINDOW_SIZE / AFD_INFO_SEND_WINDOW_SIZE.
 *
 * The two divergences:
 *
 * 1. Default window size. The checks below accept 0x1000 or 0x2000, which
 *    matches ReactOS: AfdReceiveWindowSize and AfdSendWindowSize are both
 *    0x2000 (drivers/network/afd/afd/main.c), and are copied into
 *    FCB->Recv.Size / FCB->Send.Size when the endpoint is created. Real
 *    Windows reports 65536 (0x10000) for both.
 *
 * 2. Setting the window size on an *unconnected* socket. The checks below
 *    expect STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER; real Windows returns STATUS_SUCCESS
 *    (0). ReactOS's set path (drivers/network/afd/afd/info.c) only acts when
 *    FCB->SharedData.State == SOCKET_STATE_CONNECTED or the endpoint is
 *    AFD_ENDPOINT_CONNECTIONLESS, and otherwise takes an else branch
 *    returning STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.
 *
 * A second-order consequence of that same set path: it accepts a value only
 * when 0 < Ulong < 0xFFFF, so ReactOS cannot accept 65536 - real Windows's
 * own default - even on a connected socket.
 *
 * CORRECTION (measured 2026-08-25): the opening claim above - that these
 * expectations encode ReactOS's behaviour - is NOT true of all 107. Run on
 * ReactOS itself (0.4.17-x86-dev, commit 7ee3248, i386, qemu TCG), this test
 * reports 8 failures, deterministic across repeated runs:
 *
 *   windowsize.c:194,197,208,211,322,325,336,339
 *   "Invalid size: 8193 8192" and "Invalid size: 8191 8192"
 *
 * All eight are the same shape: the test sets a window size to Orig+1 or
 * Orig-1, the set returns STATUS_SUCCESS, and the test then expects the
 * read-back to still be Orig - i.e. it expects the odd value to be rejected
 * or rounded. ReactOS stores the value verbatim and hands back 8193 / 8191.
 *
 * So the honest statement is narrower than the one above: these expectations
 * match ReactOS on the *default size* and *unconnected set* questions, and
 * disagree with it on set/get round-tripping of a non-granular size. Neither
 * implementation satisfies the whole file. Do not cite this test as "passes
 * on ReactOS" without qualification.
 *
 * These expectations are deliberately left as they are. They correctly
 * describe ReactOS, which is this test's primary target, and rewriting them
 * to match Windows would break the test where it is actually run. Nor is
 * the driver wrong by accident: ReactOS models the window as a real
 * in-driver buffer it allocates in the set path, so honouring a set on an
 * unconnected socket would mean deferring or restructuring that allocation,
 * and raising the bound past 0xFFFF changes allocation behaviour. That is a
 * deliberately simpler model, recorded here rather than "fixed".
